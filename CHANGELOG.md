# CHANGELOG

## v0.8.20

### Fixed

- Fixed storage status showing `Expansion recommended` after the root filesystem was already expanded.
- Replaced unsafe whole-disk-vs-partition-size expansion decision with actual partition tail-free-space detection.
- Avoids treating `/boot`, BIOS partitions, and partition start offsets as growable space.
- `expand-root-storage` now skips `growpart` when no growable disk tail exists and only uses existing LVM free space when available.

### Improved

- `storage-debug` now prints both detector and evaluator output.
- `storage-status` can display growable disk tail space when present.

## v0.8.19

- Added optional app checkpoint workflow.
- Added app install wizard and rollback guidance.
